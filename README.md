# What is this?
This is where I keep all the code for me learning openGL. Each commit will be a new thing I learn or a new thing I make. For exmaple the "Hello Triangle" commit where I created a window and triangle for the first time.

## What can you do with this repo?
Use it to learn yourself. This is the first time I really tried to make anything with OpenGL.

#Compiling

I cant figure out how to do CMAKE and this is not meant to be a serious project although if you want to make me a cmakelists file then go right ahead.
